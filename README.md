# Museum DLL Pack

Here you can find DLLs that [museum](https://wolverinesoft.github.io/museum) games might require in order to function. These were acquired from
official microsoft installers, so they are known to be safe. 

`OpenAL32.dll` was created using [OpenAL-Soft](https://openal-soft.org/). Museum maintainers: ensure a copy of [license-openalsoft.txt](license-openalsoft.txt) is 
included in every repaired game that includes this `OpenAL32.dll`.
